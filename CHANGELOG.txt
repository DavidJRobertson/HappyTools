18 April 2017
 - Added background subtracted version of absolute area
 - Added background subtracted version of relative area
 - Added peak noise output (standard deviation of the quantitation window)
 - Added a filter on calibration (files that contain 'blank' or 'blanc' won't be calibrated)

22 April 2017
 - Fixed background subtraction (standard absolute/relative areas were already background
   subtracted)
 - Added a HappyTools settings block to the results file
 - Added a build variable (US notation of the date, additional letters (a, b, etc.) if
   multiple builds on one day
 - Added progress bars to HappyTools (calibration and integration) by implementing MassyTools
   based logic. The code to update the progress bar has been turned into a reusable function
   (functions.updateProgressBar)

24 April 2017
 - Added option to select the desired outputs in the results file
 - Added a format() to the retention time post calibration, ensuring that the numbers are
   written as a decimal number as opposed to scientific notation

2 June 2017
 - Fixed a bug that would cause the program to crash when a local minima or maxima could
   not be determined
 - Added an option to specify the desired number of decimal numbers (this also fixes a bug
   that caused the program to write scientific notation for some numbers)

7 June 2017
 - Tweaked the look of the pop-up windows (batch process, output options and settings)
 - Added specific titles to each window that is generated by HappyTools
 - Added an 'About' button to the menu

20 June 2017
 - Added plugin support to HappyTools (put a single file in the plugins directory that contains
   a start function as the entry point for HappyTools)
 - Added proper closing of the Python window when HappyTools is closed

21 June 2017
 - Added settings to choose minimum number of peaks for calibration and the minimum S/N
   for a peak to be included in the calibration

23 June 2017
 - Added a plot of the entire chromatogram region of interest (between the start and end
   parameters), if the saveFigure setting is set to True.

12 July 2017
 - Implemented calibrant validation based on specified minimum number of calibrant peaks
   and the minimum S/N for a peak to be included in the calibration.
 - Added function that creates basic PagesPdf file, which severely limits the number of PDF
   files that are created by HappyTools.
 - Added a check to see if the current file is not in the EXCLUSION_FILES of HappyTools.
 - Added a default value for currNoise to functions.backgroundNoise, which should prevent
   HappyTools from crashing when attempting to process a non-chromatogram input file.
 - Added a check to see if the X-axis begin and end can be found (via a bisect search)
   prior to opening a PdfPages object in batchQuantifyChrom.

24 July 2017
 - Added the peakDetectionMin setting to the settings window, including the possibility
   to save this parameter (thereby ensuring that the user does not have to edit the code
   of HappyTools).

24 August 2017
 - Added an option to zoom in on a specific region of the chromatogram using a new button
   in the GUI, that is labelled as "Define the X- and Y-axis limits".

1 September 2017
 - Added an option to overlay the quantitation windows onto a plotted chromatogram via the
   File -> Overlay Quantitation Windows button.
 - The quantitation overlay is added to the overal chromatogram during a batchProcess if the
   createFigure setting is set to True.

11 November 2017
 - Implemented a FWHM determination, that is included in the plots of each individual peak
   of the PDF files.
 - FWHM values will also be printed to the summary if the Peak Quality Criteria are selected
   in the Output Options of Batch Process.
 - Implemented a retention time residual, that is printed to the summary if the Peak Quality
   Criteria are selected in the Output Options of Batch Process.

16 November 2017
 - Implemented automatic integration window border determination using either sigma or FWHM.
 - Two new settings have been added to the settings window, namely 'Peak Detection Edge Method'
   and 'Sigma Value'. The first specifies if the border is the FWHM or based on a user
   specified Sigma value. The latter specifies what Sigma value should be used, if the first
   is set to Sigma.

24 November 2017
 - Fixed a bug that caused a peak to be shifted if there were more than 2 peaks overlapping.
   This was caused by the i['Peak'] value no longer being in the middle of i['Data'] after
   the border was changed. The fix was to always compare to relevant border of i['Data'] to
   i['Peak'] rather than the two opposite ends of i['Data'].
 - Applied the above mentioned fix on the generated peak list as well.

4 December 2017
 - Restructured batchQuantifyChrom function in batchFunctions.py to enable better try and 
   except usage. This restructuring solved several issues that were plagueing HappyTools.
 - Fixed potential ZeroDivisionErrors that could occur in the batchQuantifyChrom function.
 - FitPack errors deriving from trying to fit a function on too little datapoints can no
   longer occur.
