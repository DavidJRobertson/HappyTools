18 April 2017
 - Added background subtracted version of absolute area
 - Added background subtracted version of relative area
 - Added peak noise output (standard deviation of the quantitation window)
 - Added a filter on calibration (files that contain 'blank' or 'blanc' won't be calibrated)

22 April 2017
 - Fixed background subtraction (standard absolute/relative areas were already background
   subtracted)
 - Added a HappyTools settings block to the results file
 - Added a build variable (US notation of the date, additional letters (a, b, etc.) if
   multiple builds on one day
 - Added progress bars to HappyTools (calibration and integration) by implementing MassyTools
   based logic. The code to update the progress bar has been turned into a reusable function
   (functions.updateProgressBar)

24 April 2017
 - Added option to select the desired outputs in the results file
 - Added a format() to the retention time post calibration, ensuring that the numbers are
   written as a decimal number as opposed to scientific notation

2 June 2017
 - Fixed a bug that would cause the program to crash when a local minima or maxima could
   not be determined
 - Added an option to specify the desired number of decimal numbers (this also fixes a bug
   that caused the program to write scientific notation for some numbers)
